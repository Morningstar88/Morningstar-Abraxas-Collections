## JAKE MACKENZIE VS THE GUARDIAN

Thank you for presiding over this case.

I certainly do not wish to abuse any court process, as claimed by the defendant in 10(3.2).

I have never taken anyone to court before, and I am simply asking that this case is overseen by fair, impartial judges.

## I'm claiming against the Guardian because their coverage contributed towards a worldwide panic which caused, health, travel, transport and social problems for many British citizens, and businesses, at home in the UK, or abroad.

The Guardian Newspaper wrote at least dozens of articles claiming that:

- There was a virus.

- Lockdowns and vaccines were an appropriate response to this virus.

- Taxpayer money should be given to Moderna, Pfizer et al, to pay for unproven vaccines.

Ministers in the UK have secured new contracts to buy 114m more Covid-19 vaccines for the next two years.

The deals, for 2022 and 2023, were accelerated after the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, officials said. Under the agreements, the UK will buy 54m more doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and 60m more doses from Moderna.

I believe that the Guardian Media Group's claim that there was a virus, was negligent, dangerous, biased,and poorly fact-checked.

In the following article, they refer to "some experts" without even naming them. I find this approach to be in violation of the Guardian's Duty of Care towards the British public, their readership, and expatraites abroad.
Only Sajid Javid is named... all other parties are faceless, unnacountable. 


The Guardian's coverage of the 'pandemic' contributed significantly to the hysteria in the UK.

Guardian articles promoted vaccines as a viable response to the virus.

Nasal Swabs, intimidate...

When the vaccines were released, in 2021 and 2022, there was no care taken to ensure that there was an appropriate testing period, to guard against side-effects, toxins, and long term health effects.

The Guardian's promotion of vaccines was both reckless and biased. In the initial stages, they did nothing to question the lucrative narratives being pushed by pharmaceutical companies, who stood to make hundreds of millions from vaccine contracts.

This promotion of vaccines in the Guardian's coverage, amounts to medical coercion, where those who were unvaccinated, were asked to stay at home. MORE

The vaccines were rushed out, without a proper testing period. The Guardian knew this, chose to ignore the dangers, and put the health of many British citizens at risk, both in the UK, and abroad, as their periodical is read worldwide.

The Guardian's pushing of the COVID narrative contributed to worldwide lockdowns, where many people, including myself, lost significant income. My income in Taipei went from an average of 1000 pounds per month, to 300, as students were ordered to stay at home. The Guardian's pushing of the pharmaceutical narrative contributed directly to this situation.

My supervisor at work, Derek Rhodes, is a British citizen, and contributed to vax blaimalil. PROVE, screengrab.

I therefore believe the Guardian's coverage of the virus and vaccine to be negligent, psychologically hurtful, financially damaging to millions of livelihoods, and a contribution towards the violation of several basic human rights...

Human Rights Violated

The right to do business in a high street or shopping precinct without government or corporate interference. The Guardian's coverage contributed to worldwide lockdown hysteria in many expatriate communities, including the Taipei business community.

The right to travel on buses, trains, and aeroplanes without being coerced into taking dangerously untested vaccines, which could be harmful or fatal to human health. The Guardian promoted vaccine transport PROVE.

The right of the British Public, and myself, to have a testing period of 5-10 years, before vaccines were released. Under penalty of perjury, I saw several acquaintances and friends hit with dangerous side-effects from the vaccines. One twenty-six year old Taiwanese lady developed shaking in her hands soon after being vaccinated. Other friends complained of severe tiredness. I knew two people who developed Bell's Palsy. I had another friend who developed flu for months.

The Guardian, in times of peace and war, is under a very serious obligation to every UK citizen to fact check their claims, and act with integrity, calm and diligence. I believe they did not meet this obligation, and instead promoted unfounded medical hysteria, putting the lives, health, travel plans and savings of many UK citizens in jeopardy.

The right to choose nutritional and natural remedies without having pharmaceutical products forced upon us. The Guardian did not consider any alternatives, and instead PROVE SCREENGRAB.
In short, The Guardian took part in a prolonged national blackmail scheme, in which dangerous, untested vaccines were forced upon British citizens, at home and abroad, by multiple South East Asian governments.

It was made clear, in multiple Guardian articles, that those who did not take the vaccine would not have access to infrastructure. PROVE.

The Guardian's articles, biased towards pharmaceutical narratives, was a direct contributor to myself, and others losing access to our jobs, public spaces, free-will to make health decisions, and international transport.

I have laid out my case, as best I can, and I ask the courts of Katherine House to find against them.

TWO: STEPHEN GOEDHART

Regarding the Stephen Goedhart claim, I understand, your honour, that this is a fairly hard to prove claim.

I will be content if the Guardian would sign an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, that they have never done business with Mr Stephen Goedhart, nor acted under his influence. Nor have they participated in any AR or VR simulations run

I enclose the form.

I understand that the court will want to judge each case separately.

I believe I have every right to seek legal remedy, and a sworn statement from The Guardian.

If the Guardian are honest, and clear of conscience, they can sign the form and return it within a few minutes.

SUMMARY

I too seek a speedy resolution to this case.

I do not need a face to face trial either. I am not presently in the UK, and don't have a 100% reliable internet connection.

I would prefer that this case is judged, 100% online, by a judge,.

I am simply asking, that an honest and fair judge look at the case, and make a decision.
I do not believe, as the Guardian claims, that I have abused any court procedure. In fact, it is my strong belief the Guardian newspaper abused the goodwill, credulity and decency of the British public, acting as they did, in the service of medical profits, hysteria, restriction of freedom of movement, and business. CLARIFY.

I have done my best, as a layman, to follow procedure.

I have done my best to present a clear, concise case, to the best of my ability.

I await the response from the court, and perhaps the Guardian legal team.

Yours Faithfully,

Jake Mackenzie
