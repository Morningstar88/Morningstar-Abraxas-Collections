## JAKE MACKENZIE VS THE GUARDIAN

Dear Moneyclaim, and Katherine House,

Thank you for presiding over this case.

I certainly do not wish to abuse any court process, as claimed by the defendant in 10(3.2) of their response pack.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5125dc2f-fb49-4161-8a4b-647db92f17af)

I have never taken anyone to court before, and I am simply asking that this case be overseen by fair, impartial judges.

*

#### *I'm claiming against the Guardian because their biased coverage contributed towards a worldwide vaccine panic which caused, health, travel, transport and social problems for many British citizens and businesses, both at home in the UK, or abroad. Virus and Vaccine hysteria, caused directly by the Guardian and other UK periodicals, caused widespread problems in the Taipei business community. Not only were we ordered to sit at home, but a once thriving Corporate Training business in the centre of Taipei, lost 80% of its business, as students were asked to sit at home, or not come to class.* 

The Guardian, as UK citizens over the age of 18, are directly responsible for fact-checking, and reporting unbiasedly. This, they did not do, for a period of 2 to 3 years. Their coverage made an entire nation sit at home. Vaccines were presented as the only viable path out. This is a clear case of denial of infrastructure, and premeditated blackmail.

## Viruses, Lockdowns, and Vaccine Contracts

From 2020 to 2023, The Guardian Newspaper wrote dozens, if not hundreds of articles on the coronavirus pandemic:

- There was a worldwide virus.

- Lockdowns, draconian restrictions and dangerous vaccines were an appropriate, proportionate response to this virus.

- Taxpayer money, amounting to hundreds of millions of pounds, should be given to Moderna, Pfizer et al, to pay for unproven vaccines.

#### Extra Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna jabs for 2022 and 2023 ordered to ‘future proof’ vaccine programme. Ministers in the UK have secured new contracts to buy 114m more Covid-19 vaccines for the next two years.

The deals, for 2022 and 2023, were accelerated after the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant, officials said. Under the agreements, the UK will buy 54m more doses from Pfizer/BioNTech and 60m more doses from Moderna.

- We are told by the Guardian that a new variant, imaginitively named Omnicron, has emerged. We are told that the government must secure a new vaccine contract. The Guardian's reporting lacks coherency, and makes no objective sense, in the calmness of hindsight.

I believe that the Guardian Media Group's claim that there was a virus, was negligent, dangerous, pharmaceutically biased, and poorly fact-checked.

The Guardian's coverage of the 'pandemic' contributed significantly to the hysteria in the UK.

In the following article, they refer to "some experts" without even naming them. Only Sajid Javid is named... all other parties are faceless, unnacountable. I find this approach to be in violation of the Guardian's Duty of Care towards the British public, their readership, and expatraites abroad. A vaccine or virus expert should be named publicly. Otherwise the appellation 'expert' is nothing more than a bluff.

## The Gaurdian took part in Vaccine Intimidation

The people of the United Kingdom, and myself, were forced to sit at home, doing little business, and not flying abroad, while more vulnerable members of our society were intimidated, by The Guardian, into taking experimental vaccines which had hardly been tested. 


Nasal Swabs, intimidate...

## The Guardian promoted a vaccine panic

When the vaccines were released, in 2021 and 2022, there was no care taken to ensure that there was an appropriate testing period, to guard against side-effects, toxins, and long term health effects.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66bc29fc-cdac-4898-b845-7be868d86e5a)


The Guardian's promotion of vaccines was both reckless and biased. In the initial stages, they did nothing to question the lucrative narratives being pushed by pharmaceutical companies, who stood to make hundreds of millions from vaccine contracts.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77d9c095-f004-4205-a598-40fee371296b)


This promotion of vaccines in the Guardian's coverage, amounts to medical coercion, where those who were unvaccinated, were asked to stay at home. MORE

The vaccines were rushed out, without a proper testing period. The Guardian knew this, chose to ignore the dangers, and put the health of many British citizens at risk, both in the UK, and abroad, as their periodical is read worldwide.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/dec/01/texas-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-lawsuit-effectiveness

The Guardian's pushing of the COVID narrative contributed to worldwide lockdowns, where many people, including myself, lost significant income. My income in Taipei went from an average of 1000 pounds per month, to 300, as students were ordered to stay at home. The Guardian's pushing of the pharmaceutical narrative contributed directly to this situation.

I therefore believe the Guardian's coverage of the virus and vaccine to be negligent, psychologically hurtful, financially damaging to millions of livelihoods, and a contribution towards the violation of several basic human rights...

Human Rights Violated

The right to do business in a high street or shopping precinct without government or corporate interference. The Guardian's coverage contributed to worldwide lockdown hysteria in many expatriate communities, including the Taipei business community.

The right to travel on buses, trains, and aeroplanes without being coerced into taking dangerously untested vaccines, which could be harmful or fatal to human health. The Guardian promoted vaccine transport PROVE.

The right of the British Public, and myself, to have a testing period of 5-10 years, before vaccines were released. Under penalty of perjury, I saw several acquaintances and friends hit with dangerous side-effects from the vaccines. One twenty-six year old Taiwanese lady developed shaking in her hands soon after being vaccinated. Other friends complained of severe tiredness. I knew two people who developed Bell's Palsy. I had another friend who developed flu for months.

The Guardian, in times of peace and war, is under a very serious obligation to every UK citizen to fact check their claims, and act with integrity, calm and diligence. I believe they did not meet this obligation, and instead promoted unfounded medical hysteria, putting the lives, health, travel plans and savings of many UK citizens in jeopardy.

The right to choose nutritional and natural remedies without having pharmaceutical products forced upon us. The Guardian did not consider any alternatives, and instead PROVE SCREENGRAB.

Covid conspiracies – in common with most conspiracy theories – are often presented in the form of complex, pseudo-technical documents. The idea that the WHO has criticised the UK’s use of PCR testing, for instance, is based on a misreading of a highly technical bit of lab guidance attached to the tests. This kind of thing is difficult to factcheck, and besides, factchecking is of limited use in changing believers’ minds, because sources such as the BBC or the Office for National Statistics are seen as untrustworthy, part of the lie. “If you don’t want to be convinced, then it’s not going to happen,” says Jon Roozenbeek, a Cambridge academic who studies disinformation.

In short, The Guardian took part in a prolonged national blackmail scheme, in which dangerous, untested vaccines were forced upon British citizens, at home and abroad, by multiple South East Asian governments.

It was made clear, in multiple Guardian articles, that those who did not take the vaccine would not have access to infrastructure. PROVE.

The Guardian's articles, biased towards pharmaceutical narratives, was a direct contributor to myself, and others losing access to our jobs, public spaces, free-will to make health decisions, and international transport.

I have laid out my case, as best I can, and I ask the courts of Katherine House to find against them.

TWO: STEPHEN GOEDHART

Regarding the Stephen Goedhart claim, I understand, your honour, that this is a fairly hard to prove claim.

I will be content if the Guardian would sign an affidavit, under penalty of perjury, that they have never done business with Mr Stephen Goedhart, nor acted under his influence. Nor have they participated in any AR or VR simulations run

I enclose the form.

I understand that the court will want to judge each case separately.

I believe I have every right to seek legal remedy, and a sworn statement from The Guardian.

If the Guardian are honest, and clear of conscience, they can sign the form and return it within a few minutes.

SUMMARY

I too seek a speedy resolution to this case.

I do not need a face to face trial either. I am not presently in the UK, and don't have a 100% reliable internet connection.

I would prefer that this case is judged, 100% online, by a judge,.

I am simply asking, that an honest and fair judge look at the case, and make a decision.
I do not believe, as the Guardian claims, that I have abused any court procedure. In fact, it is my strong belief the Guardian newspaper abused the goodwill, credulity and decency of the British public, acting as they did, in the service of medical profits, hysteria, restriction of freedom of movement, and business. CLARIFY.

I have done my best, as a layman, to follow procedure.

I have done my best to present a clear, concise case, to the best of my ability.

I await the response from the court, and perhaps the Guardian legal team.

Yours Faithfully,

Jake Mackenzie

1. "Novavax expected to be become fourth Covid vaccine available in UK" – This article discusses the Novavax vaccine, which is a protein-based jab with potential reduced side-effects. The UK government ordered 60 million doses, and it could be a valuable addition to the vaccination arsenal¹.

2. "UK begins donating millions of COVID-19 vaccines overseas" – While not directly about vaccine support in the UK, this article highlights the UK's commitment to sharing vaccines globally. The UK donated the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to developing countries via the Covax initiative².

3. "Covid vaccine: How many people are vaccinated in the UK?" – Although not an article, this BBC report provides information on the number of vaccine doses ordered by the UK, including Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for use in 2022 and 2023³.
